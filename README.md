# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-Nigeria's Importation Data
This is an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), using Python programming language in Jupyter Notebook, on raw data obtained on Nigeria's Importation in 2019 (January - December) through the Central Bank of Nigeria. The analysis answers some key questions about the role of importation in the Nigerian economy, major currency that influences international trade and economy, importers and financiers of the imports. It also answers the question of which items were mostly imported and commonly used means to fund the imports. The analysis presents some insights that can be gained from the analysis. Attached are an .ipynb, .pptx and video presentation by my team and i explaining some of the insights and relationships from the analysis.
